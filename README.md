## 💡 **About the Project**

**OK Clinic** is a **web-based Veterinary Clinic Management System** developed as part of our integration project for **ITCC 33 (Database Systems), CSCC 21 (Software Engineering), and ITCC 14 (API Development)**.
This platform is designed to **streamline veterinary operations** by providing an all-in-one solution for managing **appointments, patient (pet) medical records, billing, and staff scheduling**.

The system allows pet owners to easily **book appointments online**, while veterinarians and clinic staff can **manage patient information, medical records, and invoices** through a secure and efficient interface. The integration of **MongoDB** and **Firebase** ensures reliable data storage and real-time updates, such as doctor availability and appointment notifications.

Built with **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express.js/NestJS)** for the backend, OK Clinic demonstrates our team’s ability to implement **RESTful APIs**, handle **secure data transactions**, and deliver a **responsive, user-centered application**.
Through this project, we aim to enhance digital efficiency in veterinary care while showcasing our technical and collaborative expertise.

### 🐾 **Milestone 1: Project Proposal & System Introduction**

**What we’ll do:**

- Finalize the project topic and define the **core problem** — the need for a unified, efficient veterinary clinic management system.
- Identify key **modules** (Appointments, Patients, Doctors, Billing, Notifications).
- Complete the initial project proposal document (Chapters 1 & 2).
- Create the **first draft of API documentation**, listing planned endpoints (e.g., `/patients`, `/appointments`, `/owners`, `/medicalrecords`).

**Deliverables:**

- Updated `README.md` with a **Problem Statement** and **Data Models** section.
- Completed `ITCC14 Final Project Doc` (Chapters 1 & 2).
- Initial `api.yaml` or Postman collection listing endpoints.

**Checklist:**

- ✅ Team meeting to finalize topic
- ✅ Complete Chapter 1 & 2 of proposal
- ✅ Create and commit `api.yaml` with endpoints
- ✅ Push all files to GitHub

---

### 💻 **Milestone 2: Backend Initialization & Documentation**

**What we’ll do:**

- Initialize repository and install dependencies (`Node.js`, `Express.js`, `MongoDB`, `Firebase`).
- Set up **core endpoints** for patient registration and doctor listing.
- Draft **OpenAPI documentation** with request/response schemas.
- Implement proper Git workflow (feature branches + commits).

**Deliverables:**

- Running backend server with working `/patients` and `/doctors` endpoints.
- Updated `api_documentation.yaml` with examples.
- Linked GitHub repo with updated `README.md`.
- Continue writing Chapter 3 of `ITCC14 Final Project Doc`.

**Checklist:**

- ✅ Repo created + dependencies installed
- 🟠 `/patients` and `/doctors` and endpoints working (ONGOING)
- 🟠 Updated API documentation
- 🟠 Commits pushed to GitHub

---

### ⚙️ **Milestone 3: Full Backend API Development**

**What we’ll do:**

- Complete CRUD operations for all modules (Patients, Appointments, Billing, Notifications, etc).
- Implement **authentication** and **validation** for secure access.
- Integrate **Firebase** for real-time doctor availability and alerts.
- Add seed data for testing and demos.

**Deliverables:**

- Fully functional backend with all endpoints tested locally.
- Seed data and test instructions in `README.md`.
- Validated OpenAPI spec (no schema errors).

**Checklist:**

- 🟠 All endpoints implemented (CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED THE FF: PET PATIENTS, OWNERS, MEDICAL RECORDS, AND APPOINTMENTS)
- 🟠 Authentication & validation added
- [ ] Firebase integration tested* (this might be scrapped because we found out that we can do authentication in MongoDB)
- [ ] Seed data ready
- [ ] OpenAPI validated

---

### 🧠 **Milestone 4: Frontend Integration (React.js)**

**What we’ll do:**

- Build an interactive React.js frontend that connects to the backend API.
- Implement modules for **appointments, patient management, billing**, and **doctor dashboard**.
- Handle loading, error, and success states gracefully.

**Deliverables:**

- Frontend UI that interacts with backend endpoints.
- Documentation on how to run and connect frontend and backend.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Frontend lists patient and appointment data
- [ ] Appointment creation & updates functional
- [ ] Billing interface connected
- [ ] UI handles loading/errors
- [ ] Run instructions documented

---

### 🐳 **Milestone 5: Deployment & Containerization**

**Why:** Ensure consistent deployment and hosting environment.

**What we’ll do:**

- Configure **Netlify** for frontend deployment and **backend hosting**.
- Write a `Dockerfile` for backend containerization (optional).
- Add deployment instructions and environment variable setup to `README.md`.

**Deliverables:**

- Live deployed site + documentation.
- Working Docker build (optional).

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Backend deployed
- [ ] Frontend deployed on Netlify
- [ ] Dockerfile builds successfully
- [ ] README updated with deployment steps

---

### 🚀 **Final: System Demo & Presentation**

**What we’ll do:**

- Present the **OK Clinic Veterinary Management System** — showcasing the problem, solution, and live demo.
- Demonstrate **real-time functionality**, **API documentation**, and **frontend integration**.
- Share GitHub repository, deployed app link, and quickstart guide.

**Deliverables:**

- Slide deck or project summary document.
- Demo script or walkthrough plan.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Slides ready
- [ ] Demo environment set up
- [ ] Backup (screenshots/video) ready
- [ ] GitHub + live link shared
